This is a "transimpedance amplifier"--an amplifier with a current input and
a voltage output, constructed using an op-amp. &nbsp;Since the input current
to the op-amp is zero, the current in the feedback resistor has to be equal
to the input current. &nbsp;The op-amp provides the output voltage necessary
to equalize these currents with the inverting input voltage held equal to
the non-inverting input voltage (which is zero since it's tied to ground).<br>
<br>
This type of amplifier is often used in optoelectronics, because photodetectors
are typically operated so as to produce a current output that then must be
amplified.<br>
