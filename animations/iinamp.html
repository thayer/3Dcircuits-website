<br>
This is a conventional inverting amplifier driven from a current source instead
of a voltage source. &nbsp;The result is that the input resistor doesn't
really matter (a resistor in series with a current source can't matter) and
the output is the same as in the previous circuit that had no input resistor.
&nbsp;The values are: 1 k input resistor, 5 k output resistor, 1 mA input
current (peak), op-amp gain 10,000.<br>
