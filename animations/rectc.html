        This circuit takes an ac input voltage (represented by the battery
 symbol),    and produces a dc voltage across the load, represented by a
resistor.&nbsp;    <br>
<ul>
  <li>Note the large surge of current drawn when the circuit first turns on.</li>
  <li>Smaller, but still significant surges are drawn each time the diode 
   turns on.&nbsp; Each pulse starts with very high amplitude and gradually 
  decreases.&nbsp; Can you explain that shape?&nbsp; (Hint:&nbsp; Capacitor 
  current <i>i<sub> C</sub> = C dv<sub>C</sub>/dt</i>.)</li>
  <li>While the diode is off, the resistor and capacitor form a simple RC 
   circuit.</li>
</ul>
