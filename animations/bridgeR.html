<h2>Bridge Rectifier Circuit.</h2>
 &nbsp; This circuit takes an ac input voltage (represented by the battery 
symbol),&nbsp; and produces a pulsating dc voltage across the load (resistor).<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Although the two ends of the resistor (load) may swing positive or
negative, the polarity of the voltage <i>across</i> the resitor is always
the same.</li>
  <li>The voltage at one end of the input voltage source is considered zero
volts, or ground, for this illustration.&nbsp; Note that the voltages at
the two ends of the resistor are not at ground; thus the circuit cannot have
a common ground between the input voltage source and the load.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
