<h2><font color="#e80000">Putting 3-D Circuit Animations from <br>
          The <a href="index.html">Circuit Animation Toolbox</a>
  on the Web</font></h2>
 
<div align="Left">We have had the best results putting line-art animations 
on the web using GIF format. &nbsp;Typical video compression schemes do poorly 
because they are designed for photographic images--they result in large file 
sizes and poor quality when used with circuit animations. &nbsp;Another format 
that can be expected to work well is MNG (<a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/mng/">
 Multiple-image Network Graphics</a>
 ), based on the corresponding PNG (<a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/">
 Portable Network Graphics</a>
 ) format. &nbsp;<br>
 <br>
 The process we have used works as follows. &nbsp;We save graphics from MATLAB 
to an uncompressed avi file (because the available compression schemes don't 
work well). &nbsp;Then we use <a href="http://www.mindworkshop.com/alchemy/gifcon.html">
 GIF Contruction Set Professional</a>
 , an inexpensive shareware program by <a href="http://www.mindworkshop.com/alchemy/alchemy.html">
 Alchemy Mindworks</a>
 , to convert to GIF and compress the files. &nbsp;Alchemy Mindworks' <a href="http://www.mindworkshop.com/alchemy/pngpro.html">
 PNG/MNGContruction Set Professional</a>
  should work similarly for MNG animations. &nbsp;The detailed process is 
outlined below<br>
<br>
Please <a href="mailto:charles.r.sullivan@dartmouth.edu">email me</a>
  a link to animations you create, so that we can put a link to it on the
page of <a

<blockquote></blockquote>
   
  <ol>
     <li>Modify the m-file for the circuit you wish to animate by using <tt>
 saveanimation(....)</tt> in place of <tt>canimate(...)</tt>, using the same 
arguments. &nbsp;A nice way to do this is to add an optional input argument&nbsp;<tt>
 save</tt> that is omitted to run the animation directly, or set to one to 
save it to disk, as in this code, which assumes three other input arguments 
before <tt>save</tt>.<br>
       <br>
       <tt>if nargin&lt;4, save = 0; end&nbsp;&nbsp; % Sets it up to not
save anything if save has not been specified.<br>
 if save<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; saveanimation(t,vm,cvm,im,ca,ia,rate,switchm);<br>
 else<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; canimate(t,vm,cvm,im,ca,ia,rate,switchm);<br>
 end</tt><br>
       <br>
 Do not loop the animation yet--the file will be big enough (10s of MB) without 
looping!<br>
       <br>
     </li>
     <li>Run the animation and select a file to save to. &nbsp;The code is 
set up to save a maximum of 100 frames in a single file, and to prompt you 
for a new filename if the animation runs more than 100 frames. &nbsp;This 
is to keep the file sizes manageable. &nbsp;If you run this on a machine with
plenty of memory, you may be able to change this and use larger files--change 
the variable <tt>maxframes </tt>in <tt>saveanimation.</tt> &nbsp;It is recommended 
that you leave the figure window active and not run other applications while 
saving the animation; otherwise bits of other images can get in the file.<br>
       <br>
     </li>
     <li>Launch GIF Construction Set Professional. &nbsp;You may wish to
quit MATLAB and other programs first, as this process will require a lot
of memory<br>
       <br>
     </li>
     <li>Convert your avi file to gif from the 'File: Movie: Movie to GIF' 
menu item. &nbsp;Select loop if you wish for it to loop. &nbsp;Save the GIF 
file and repeat for each 100-frame file if your animation has been broken 
into multiple files.<br>
       <br>
     </li>
     <li>Merge the multiple files together. &nbsp;Start by opening one, and 
positioning the insertion point where you want to add the others (typically 
at the end of the sequence). &nbsp;Select 'Merge' from the 'Block' menu to 
add the frames from another file. &nbsp;Repeat for as many files as the animation 
has been broken down into.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Select the 'Supercompress' option from the file menu to compress
this merged file.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>The animation can then be placed on the web. &nbsp;It is helpful
to put an html 'wrapper' on it, because some web browsers (e.g., Internet
Explorer) may open a GIF file using a still image editor rather than displaying
the animation in the web browser, if given the GIF file in the URL directly,
rather than being pointed to an html page that containts the image.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Send <a href="mailto:charles.r.sullivan@dartmouth.edu">me</a>
 a link to your animation, so that we can put a link to it on the page of
      <a href="animations/">animations on-line</a>
